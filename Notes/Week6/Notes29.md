# Modeling a Web Application

## Explain threat modeling using real-world non-technical examples.
Physical Security for a Jewelry Store:
- Identify valuable assets.
- Consider potential threat actors and vulnerabilities.
- Analyze risks and prioritize countermeasures.
- Continuously review and improve security measures.
- Personal Safety in a Public Park:
Identify personal assets and potential threats.
- Assess vulnerabilities and risks.
- Implement risk mitigation measures.
- Raise awareness and educate park visitors.

## What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling?
Spoofing: "Can an attacker pretend to be someone else?"
    This question focuses on impersonation or masquerading threats. It considers whether an attacker can deceive the system or users by pretending to be a legitimate entity.
Tampering: "Can an attacker modify or manipulate data?"
    This question focuses on the integrity of data. It examines whether an attacker can modify, tamper with, or manipulate data in transit or at rest, potentially leading to unauthorized access or malicious outcomes.
Repudiation: "Can an attacker deny their actions or involvement?"
    This question deals with accountability and non-repudiation threats. It looks at whether an attacker can carry out actions without leaving traces or evidence, making it difficult to attribute those actions to a specific individual.
Information Disclosure: "Can an attacker gain access to sensitive information?"
    This question considers the confidentiality of information. It examines whether an attacker can obtain or expose sensitive data through unauthorized access, eavesdropping, or other means.
Denial of Service: "Can an attacker disrupt or degrade system availability?"
    While not part of the original STRIDE acronym, Denial of Service (DoS) is often included as an additional category. It focuses on threats that aim to disrupt or degrade the availability or performance of a system or service.

## You are the project lead for a new application. How would you explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the rest of the team?
    - Early Risk Identification: Identify and address security risks during the design phase, saving time and effort.
    - Cost-Effective Security: Integrate security measures early on, reducing the need for expensive retrofits.
    - Enhanced Security and Resilience: Design a more robust and secure application by proactively implementing countermeasures.
    - Improved Collaboration: Foster collaboration among team members and promote a security-conscious mindset.
    - Regulatory Compliance: Align with industry regulations and standards by addressing potential security gaps.
    - Customer Trust and Reputation: Build customer trust by demonstrating a proactive approach to security.
