# Malware Detection with YARA Rules

## What is the main goal of Threat Hunting and how is it different from traditional threat monitoring?
The main goal of Threat Hunting is to proactively search for and identify potential threats or security breaches within an organization's network or systems. It involves actively searching for indicators of compromise (IOCs), suspicious activities, or anomalies that may have evaded traditional security measures. The focus is on detecting threats that have bypassed or gone undetected by automated security tools.

## What are the four types of YARA rules and what does each one of them use to identify and classify malicious software?
Strings: String-based rules are the most commonly used type of YARA rule. They define specific character sequences, regular expressions, or byte patterns that are associated with known malware or suspicious behavior. These rules search for these specific strings within files or data to identify potential malware samples.

Conditionals: Conditional rules are used to define complex conditions that combine multiple strings or logical operators. They allow for more advanced matching capabilities by specifying conditions that need to be met for a rule to trigger. For example, a conditional rule may require the presence of multiple strings or specific file attributes to classify a sample as malicious.

Metadata: Metadata rules provide additional information about files or samples. They can define attributes such as file size, file type, creation date, or even digital signatures associated with known malware. Metadata rules are helpful in classifying files based on their properties and metadata information.

XOR: XOR rules are used to identify files that have been obfuscated or encrypted using the XOR operation. XOR-based obfuscation is a common technique used by malware authors to evade detection. XOR rules define specific XOR patterns that are associated with known obfuscation techniques, allowing for the identification of potentially malicious files.

## How are YARA rules similar to how Anti-Virus programs detect malicious software?
Pattern Matching: Both YARA rules and AV programs utilize pattern matching techniques to identify known malicious patterns or signatures within files. YARA rules define specific strings, regular expressions, or byte patterns associated with malware, while AV programs use signature databases that contain patterns of known malware.

Detection of Known Threats: Both YARA rules and AV programs are effective in detecting known threats. They compare the patterns or signatures defined in their rules or databases against files or data to determine if they match any known malware signatures. If a match is found, it indicates the presence of a known threat.
