# Threat Hunting with Security Onion

## How are Threat Hunting and Pentesting different?
Threat hunting actively searches for signs of ongoing or potential threats within an organization's network, using techniques like data analysis and log inspection.
Pentesting assesses the security of an organization's systems by simulating real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities.
Threat hunting is ongoing and proactive, while pentesting is conducted within a defined scope and timeframe.

## What is the primary objective of Threat Hunting?
Proactively search for signs of ongoing or potential cyber threats within an organization's network or systems.

## Your organization has a fully functioning SOC but not active Threat Hunting. How would you advocate for your security organization to start Threat Hunting activities?
