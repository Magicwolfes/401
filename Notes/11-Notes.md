# Setting up Splunk SIEM

## How would a security team benefit from implementing a SOAR solution?
SOAR solutions automate the repetitive tasks that security analysts would otherwise have to perform manually. This automation saves time, reduces errors, and frees up analysts to focus on more complex tasks.SOAR solutions can help organizations meet compliance requirements by automating security processes, providing audit trails, and enforcing security policies.

## Explain how a SOAR solution fits into the Incident Response process.
When an incident occurs, the first step is to identify it. A SOAR solution can help by automatically collecting and correlating data from various sources, including security tools, network devices, and logs. This can help identify the scope and severity of the incident and determine the appropriate response. 
Once an incident has been identified, the next step is to contain it to prevent further damage.
After containing the incident, the next step is to eradicate it by removing any malicious files, processes, or configurations. 
Once the incident has been eradicated, the next step is to recover from it by restoring affected systems and data. 
After the incident has been resolved, the final step is to review and learn from it to prevent similar incidents in the future. A SOAR solution can help by generating reports and providing insights into the incident, including the root cause, the effectiveness of the response, and areas for improvement.
