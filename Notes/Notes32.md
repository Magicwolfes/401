# Malware Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

## You just started a new job as a Malware Analyst. Explain your job responsibilities to a family member.
Well, as a Malware Analyst, my job is to investigate and analyze malicious software, also known as malware. Malware refers to any type of software or code that is designed to harm computer systems, steal information, or disrupt normal operations.

## What are the six steps of the Malware Analysis process? Whatâ€™s a good mnemonic you can use to remember it?
Collection: Gathering the malware samples or artifacts from infected systems or other reliable sources.
Examination: Conducting a preliminary examination of the malware sample to gather basic information such as file properties, behavior, and any initial indicators of compromise.
Analysis: Deep-dive analysis of the malware's code, behavior, and capabilities. This involves static analysis (examining the code without executing it) and dynamic analysis (observing the malware's behavior in a controlled environment).
Identification: Identifying the malware's purpose, functionality, and potential impact on the infected system or network.
Containment: Taking measures to prevent the malware from spreading further. This may involve isolating the infected system, disconnecting it from the network, or implementing other containment strategies.
Eradication: Removing the malware from the infected systems and restoring them to a secure state. This may include removing malicious files, cleaning up the registry, and patching vulnerabilities that the malware exploited.

## You are tasked with analyzing a new malware sample. Which type of malware analysis would you conduct first and why?
The first type of malware analysis I would conduct is static analysis. Static analysis involves examining the malware's code, structure, and other characteristics without executing it. By analyzing the malware statically, I can avoid potential risks associated with executing the malicious code. Running malware samples directly on a system can lead to unintended consequences, such as further infection or damage to the environment.
