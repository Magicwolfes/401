# Cyber Risk Analysis

## Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?
For Confidentiality The ATM can incorporate PIN verification to ensure that only authorized users can access the account balance.
For Integrity The ATM can have a mechanism to verify the authenticity of the account balance information, such as by checking digital signatures or using encryption.
And lastly for Availability 
The ATM can have a monitoring system that alerts the bank to any issues that may affect its availability, such as hardware failures or network connectivity issues.

## Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.
> Separation of duties: Prevents any one person from becoming too powerful within an organization. This policy also provides singleness of focus. For instance, a network administrator who is concerned with providing users access to resources should never be the security administrator. This policy also helps prevent collusion as there are many individuals with discrete capabilities. Separation of duties is a preventative control.

> Mandatory vacations: Prevents an operator from having exclusive use of a system.  Periodically, that individual is forced to take a vacation and relegate control of the system to someone else. This policy is a detective control.

> Job rotation: Similar in purpose to mandatory vacations, but with the added benefit of cross-training employees.

## What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stage’s main goal or objective?
> Risk assessment: Categorize, classify and evaluate assets, as well as identify threats and vulnerabilities
Looks at risks corresponding to identified parameters for a specific period and must be reevaluated periodically

> Risk analysis: Both qualitative and quantitative
Qualitative analysis is subjective in nature and uses words like “high,” “medium,” “low” to describe the likelihood and severity of the impact of a threat exposing a vulnerability.

Quantitative analysis is objective and numbers-driven. It requires more experience than qualitative analysis and involves calculations to determine a dollar value associated with each risk element.

> Risk mitigation/response: Includes reducing or avoiding risk, transferring risk, and accepting or rejecting risk
Organizations need to continue to monitor for risks. How an organization decides to mitigate business risks becomes the basis for security governance and policy.
