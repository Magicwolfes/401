# Cloud Network Security

## What are some of the key features of the VPC model?
> - Agility: Control the size of your virtual network and deploy cloud resources whenever your business needs them. You can scale these resources dynamically and in real-time.

> - Availability: Redundant resources and highly fault-tolerant availability zone architectures mean your applications and workloads are highly available.

> - Security: Because the VPC is a logically isolated network, your data and applications won’t share space or mix with those of the cloud provider’s other customers. You have full control over how resources and workloads are accessed, and by whom.

> - Affordability: VPC customers can take advantage of the public cloud’s cost-effectiveness, such as saving on hardware costs, labor times, and other resources.

## What are the three tiers that comprise the three-tier architecture model?
> - The web or presentation tier, which takes requests from web browsers and presents information created by, or stored within, the other layers to end users.

> - The application tier, which houses the business logic and is where most processing takes place.

> - The database tier, comprised of database servers that store the data processed in the application tier.

## Describe the differences between a VPC and a VPN to someone you know from your previous job.
So, the main difference between a VPC and a VPN is that a VPC is a virtual private network within a public cloud provider, whereas a VPN is a secure connection between two separate networks, typically over the internet. While a VPC is used to create an isolated environment for your cloud resources within a public cloud provider, a VPN is used to securely connect two separate networks, such as a remote worker's computer to a company's network, or two separate office locations.
