# Protecting Data at Rest with Device Encryption

## From your day to day computer use, provide examples of when data is at rest and when it is in transit.
When you save a file to your computer's hard drive, the data is stored "at rest" until you access it again.When you upload a photo or video to a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox.
When you send an email or instant message to someone, the data is considered "in transit" as it travels from your device to the recipient's device.When you use a messaging or video conferencing app, the data you send and receive is considered "in transit" as it travels between your device and the recipient's device.

## Explain the role data encryption with regards to the CIA triad.
C. Encryption is a technique that scrambles the original information into a format that can only be read by someone who has the key to unlock the encryption
I. Encryption can also help ensure the integrity of data by providing a digital signature or hash that can be used to verify the authenticity of the data.
A.  Encryption can help ensure the availability of data by protecting it from attacks that could disrupt or prevent access to the data.
