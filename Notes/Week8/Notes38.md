# Attacking Juice Shop with Burp Suite

# Explain how Burp Suite allows us to analyze web application traffic.
Burp Suite operates as an intercepting proxy, sitting between your web browser and the target web application. It captures all HTTP and HTTPS traffic, allowing you to inspect and modify the requests and responses. Burp Suite provides a comprehensive view of the responses received from the web application. You can inspect the server's responses to determine if they contain any security issues, such as sensitive information disclosure or improper error handling.

# What does the Repeater tool allow us to do with requests?
You can modify any part of the intercepted request, including headers, parameters, cookies, and body content. This feature is useful for testing different scenarios and injecting payloads to identify vulnerabilities or understand application behavior.You can define multiple payloads or a set of values for specific parameters and iterate through them automatically. This feature is particularly useful for testing scenarios that require brute forcing, such as trying different username and password combinations.

# Why might this be a useful tool for an attacker?
Attackers can use the Repeater tool to modify requests and payloads to exploit vulnerabilities in a web application. They can alter parameters, headers, or payloads to perform attacks like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or command injection, aiming to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive information, or compromise the system.
