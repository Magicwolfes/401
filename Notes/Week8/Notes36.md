# Forensics Investigation with Autopsy

## What are the main differences between computer forensics and cybersecurity?
Computer forensics focuses on investigating and analyzing digital evidence for legal purposes, reconstructing past events. Cybersecurity, on the other hand, focuses on protecting computer systems and networks from unauthorized access and attacks in real-time. Computer forensics deals with specific incidents or legal matters, while cybersecurity encompasses broader proactive measures to prevent and mitigate security threats. The skill sets and techniques used also differ, with computer forensics involving digital evidence preservation and analysis, while cybersecurity involves network security, risk management, and incident response.

## What are the six stages of a computer forensics examination?
Identification: Identify the potential sources of digital evidence.

Preservation: Safeguard and preserve the digital evidence to prevent alteration or damage.

Collection: Gather the relevant digital evidence using forensically sound methods.

Analysis: Analyze the collected evidence to extract meaningful information and uncover insights.

Documentation: Document the findings, methodologies, and processes used during the examination.

Presentation: Present the findings in a clear and concise manner, often in the form of a report or as testimony in a court of law.
