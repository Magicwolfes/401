# Readings: Data file encryption


# You have been made responsible for the companyâ€™s file server. How would you preserve the three elements of the CIA triad?
Only authorized personnel would be allowed to access the files stored on the server. Enforce strong password policies, implement multi-factor authentication, and encrypt sensitive data to ensure that it cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals. All files stored on the server are protected against unauthorized modification, deletion, or corruption. Ensure that the file server is always accessible to authorized users, and that any downtime or disruptions are kept to a minimum. 

# Explain how hashing verifies data integrity using non-technical terms.
Hashing is a process of creating a unique digital fingerprint of a piece of data.  Just like a physical seal or signature can be used to verify the authenticity of a document, a digital hash value can be used to verify the integrity of data.

# How is hashing and encryption different?
Hashing is a one-way process of generating a unique digital fingerprint of a piece of data, called a hash value. Encryption, on the other hand, is a two-way process of transforming data into an unreadable form using a secret key, called a cipher.
