# Prep Your Mind

## Upgrade Your Technical Skills

> The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:
> Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
> - Repeated often
> - Feedback on results in continuously available
> - It's highly demanding mentally
> - It's difficult
> - It requires good goals
To make things challenging you have to push yourself out of your comfort zone. You will not learn anything just practicing the easy stuff over and over again. When you are faced with something you don't full understand or do not know how to do, you are forced to overcome the gaps in your knowlegde. Constant feedback from peers is key. Even correcting the little pieces, that way it becomes second nature. You should set a gaol that teaches you something new, but isn't so impossiable that it has set you up to fail

## Growth Mindset

Intresting, grade of 'Not yet' instead of a fail. Where one might find themselves slipping on grades, instead out right failure, 'Not yet' creates a different range of feelings. Growth vs fixed minset is also intresting. I think I might have a more of a fixed minset because I know my limits, while I do like to feel challenge, maybe I tend to give up too early. Simply because I think that the task or gaol is out of reach for my abilities and the thought of failure is actually more hurtful than the challenge was.
I also run from difficulty. A fight or flight mindset and I feel a lot of people choose flight. 
> "Praise wisely. Not praising intelligence or talent, that has failed.. But prasing the process that kids enage in"
Her powerpoint is lowkey hurting my soul. But I love the video game idea. That is so weird to think about because growing up, it was just getting the answers right now and I know I suffered because of it. 

## Grit

I agree, that while being able to learn quickly doesn't equal being able to learn effectly. I personally struggled in school because simply I was just a slow learner and the pace felt so impossiable to keep up with. While I finally understood one part, the teachers had students learning the 5th part. 
> Git is passion and perserverance.. Working hard to make that future a reality.
I think it's very intresting that we don't know what builds git into our characters or a child. 
> The ability to learn is not fixed, it can change.. They don't believe that failure is permanent
