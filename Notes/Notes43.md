# Sniffing and Evasion

## Explain a Sniffing attack using non-technical terms.
Imagine your personal information and online activities are like words and sentences stored on your computer or transmitted over the internet. In a sniffing attack, a malicious person uses special tools or techniques to intercept and capture this information as it travels across networks or when it is stored on your device. They "sniff" or capture the data without your knowledge or permission.

## What are the two types of sniffing attacks and what are some pros and cons of each approach?
Passive Sniffing:
Passive sniffing involves silently capturing and monitoring network traffic without actively interfering with it. The attacker "listens in" on the data transmissions happening between devices on a network. They don't send any additional data themselves; they simply intercept and analyze the existing communication.
Active Sniffing:
Active sniffing involves injecting additional data or commands into the network to gain access to sensitive information. The attacker actively participates in the network communication by sending crafted packets or manipulating existing ones.

## How does encryption protect traffic against sniffing attacks?
Encryption plays a crucial role in protecting traffic against sniffing attacks. It ensures that even if an attacker intercepts the transmitted data, they cannot make sense of its contents without the decryption key.
