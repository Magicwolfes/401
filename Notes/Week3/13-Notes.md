# Reconstructing a Cloud Attack with Splunk

## What are the benefits of a forward proxy?
> To avoid state or institutional browsing restrictions 
> To block access to certain content
> To protect their identity online

## Explain the differences between a forward and a reverse proxy?
A forward proxy sits between a client and the internet, while a reverse proxy sits between the internet and servers in a private network. A forward proxy is primarily used to improve security, anonymity, and performance for clients accessing the internet, while a reverse proxy is primarily used to improve scalability, reliability, and security for servers in a private network.

## Explain to your manager why your organization might benefit from implementing a reverse proxy?
A reverse proxy can act as a single point of entry for all incoming traffic from the internet, which can improve security by allowing us to enforce security policies and filter out malicious traffic before it reaches our internal servers. A reverse proxy can improve scalability by distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers in our private network
